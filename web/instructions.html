<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>On the main page, a JavaScript game can be played with the seven letters that spell "Hundred".  Clicking on a letter will change its colour.  The goal of the game is to make every letter turn the same colour.</p>
<p>Blue will turn into red, red into green, green to yellow, and yellow back to blue.</p>
<p>However, each letter is randomly linked to one other letter.  For example, the letter H may be linked to the letter N.  So if you click on H, you will also change the colour of N.</p>
<p>Every time the main page is reloaded, the links will be randomly reassigned, creating a new challenge.</p>
<p>Can you make every letter turn the same colour?</p>
<p>The puzzle can be quite difficult, and may not always be possible to complete.  I've only solved it once.</p>
